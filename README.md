The project is focused on predicting preterm birth from the maternal vaginal and fecal microbiome during the second and trimester of birth.
The scripts include initial analysis such as comparison of alpha and beta diversity between group, followed by differential abundance analysis. Here, a longitudal comparison of the microbiota between the two trimesters is present.
The second script includes a randomly subsampled and repeated machine learning analysis of the microbiome profiles along with the metadata from the variables.
This is repeated post variable selection in order to reduce the noise in the models and obtain the most effective model.

Preterm birth remains the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality globally,
with rates staying unchanged despite advances in obstetric and neonatal care.
Inflammation and infection are key mechanisms implicated in preterm birth, with the
maternal microbiome emerging as a potential predictor and therapeutic target. This
study aimed to predict spontaneous preterm birth by analysing vaginal and faecal
microbiomes (collected at <20 weeks and 28–30 weeks of gestation) together with
extensive questionnaire data. Leveraging the largest microbiome cohort for preterm
birth to date (collected in Sweden, 2017–2021, with 132 cases of spontaneous preterm
birth), we developed a machine learning-based prediction model, achieving an AUROC
of 0.89. This work underscores the significant potential of early prediction for preterm
birth, highlighting that accurate prediction relies on the integration of lifestyle, health
status, and microbiome composition. Our results provide a pathway for developing
targeted prevention strategies.
